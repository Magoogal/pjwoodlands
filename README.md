Simple NetLogo models to simulate the growth of a forest. 

The aims are:

- To have trees that accumulate biomass
- Competition between individuals
- Recruitment
- Loss through mortality or harvesting

V1: Simple binary suitability and growth

V2: Added continuous suitability and biomass driven competition

V3: Added mortality
